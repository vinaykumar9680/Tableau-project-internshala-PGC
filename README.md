**Project Overview**
This project involves creating a visually interactive and informative dashboard for "The Bike Haven," a bike shop based in San Francisco. The goal is to enhance the sales reporting system by transitioning from static reports to interactive dashboards, enabling better understanding and tracking of sales performance.

**Problem Statement**
Create a visually interactive and informative dashboard of sales data for "The Bike Haven" in Tableau.

**Description**
John, the owner of The Bike Haven, started the shop out of his passion for cycling. Over the years, the shop has grown significantly, thanks to the quality of products and excellent customer service. Chris, the sales manager, recognized the need for improved sales reporting and decided to transition to interactive dashboards to gain better insights into sales performance.

**Requirements**
Chris outlined the following requirements for the dashboard:

Track sales volume of products, clients, and timeline.
Include filters for sales representatives to see data specific to their customers and products.
Compare current sales data with budgeted values for 2023.
Analyze sales data from the previous two years.

**Datasets**
Sales Data: Available in a .tar database file.
Budget Data: Provided in a budgets.csv file.

**Data Processing**

Restore the provided database into pgAdmin.
Use SQL to merge necessary tables (e.g., product, category, subcategory, customer, geography).
Remove unnecessary columns and download the processed data as CSV files for Tableau.

**Visualizations**

The dashboard must include the following visualizations:

Top 10 Products by Sales Amount: Identify products generating the most revenue.
Top 10 Customers: Recognize the most valuable customers.
Sales Figures vs. Budget: Compare actual sales to budgeted sales for each month.
Sales Figures by Region/City: Show sales performance across different regions.
Product Categories vs. Sales Amount: Analyze performance of each product category.
Additional visualizations can be added to enhance understanding and provide more insights.

**Dashboard Requirements**

Easy to navigate and understand.
Includes charts, graphs, and tables that are visually appealing.
Accessible on multiple devices (laptop, tablet, smartphone).
Created in A4 portrait size and saved in PDF format.

**Final Deliverable**

Dashboard PDF: The final dashboard should be saved as a PDF.
Demonstration Video: Record a video demonstrating the dashboard's interactivity and functionality of the filters. Upload the video to Google Drive or YouTube and share the link.
